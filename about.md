Alliedbusiness „Ç¢„É©„Ç§„Éâ„Éì„Ç∏„Éç„Çπ„ÇØ„É©„Ç¶„ÉâÂêàÂêå‰ºöÁ§æ, located in Japan, is at the forefront of accelerating AI-powered business practices through innovative software solutions. We specialize in developing Teams AI bots that empower organizations to boost productivity and efficiency by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence.

Our flagship AI software solution is built upon the "Build, Learn, and Transfer" (BLT) process, which offers a unique path for companies looking to adopt customized AI capabilities. The process begins with a standardized software solution that aligns with Microsoft's business market standards. Organizations can acquire this software through a straightforward subscription model, paying an annual fee for access to a powerful AI tool.

Upon subscribing, clients may opt for an AI Integrated Apps (AIP) agreement, allowing for deeper customization to suit their specific needs. Through this partnership, TeraTeams delivers a tailor-made AI solution, with dedicated support for the entire customization period. After a year, the bespoke AI-driven bot is transferred entirely to the client, ensuring complete autonomy and seamless integration into their business processes.

At Alliedbusiness, we strive to redefine how businesses leverage AI technology, making collaboration more intelligent, communication more streamlined, and productivity limitless.

If you encounter any technical issues or have questions about using our Teams App (Ta1010), we‚Äôre here to help!
